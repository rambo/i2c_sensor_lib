Looking into inheritance on Arduino, trying to make a sensible class hierachy for handling data reading, smoothing etc.

NOTE: This will be reorganized in such way that each class will be in separate dir that can be copied/symlinked to Arduino libraries folder, but only when it's closer to "production quality".
